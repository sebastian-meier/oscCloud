Java Framework to help synchronize multiple computers via osc in a local network

## Important Note:
This is a project i did in 2010, it was one of my first java projects and i haven't touched it since, this repo is for documentation purpose only. The libraries included in this repo are from back then and nothing has been tested with recent versions of processing or java or anything else.
